# 🌍 My Travel Journal (React)

This is a mini React project created during the early stages of my React learning journey.  
It displays a set of travel journal entries for different tourist destinations, using reusable components and props. The data is stored in a separate JavaScript file and rendered dynamically using `.map()`.

## 🚀 Project Overview

> A simple journal-style React app that displays travel destinations with images, locations, dates, and descriptions.

Each entry is displayed using a reusable `JournalEntry` component, and the travel data is imported from an external file. The app also includes a basic navbar component.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project helped me practice:
- Building and composing **reusable components**
- **Passing props** for structured data
- Using **object destructuring**
- Dynamically rendering lists with **`.map()`**
- Adding a basic layout with components like navbars
